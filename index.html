  In the homepage, I wanted to go the aesthetic route by showcasing different colours based on the drink, Arizona Iced tea.
To fulfill this theme, I went on Google Chrome and looked at all the varieties available to purchase but since this is a Japanese themed
example, the original flavour containing the green and cherry blossom pink was perfectly matched for my ideas. The images showcase how to allign
them in a row with equal spoace between, which is beneficial for presenting.
<br>
<br>
In the coming pages, there will be different themes along with effects I have implemented on images to give more interaction such as 
animation effects. I also wanted to demonstrate a dropdown navigation bar as I find that the user will have a better experience with
navigation since everything is neat and tidy.
<br>
<br>
For the "News" page I wanted to give the feel of a gloomy yet vibrant, high tech city. I leaned towards going for a fast paced place like night and
time Tokyo but for a more atmospheric feel I based it on a run down alley polluted with neon signs, the ones that
rough clubs display and street level crime takes place. 
I demonstrated a hover effect on this pages image which contains information, this could be used for educational purposes
for holding bitesize information.
<br>
<br>
I decided to only link one page for the dropdown menu as one page is only needed to demonstrate how its done, the drop down colour is a white background
and when you hover over it, turns to a light grey to give it the perfect contrast.
